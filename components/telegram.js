        Every summer Hack Club does something special.
        </p>
      <p>
        In 2019 we brought 75 Hack Club leaders to San Francisco for
        Flagship. Last year, we gave a student $50k to distribute as
        hardware grants, launched scrapbook, and hosted the Summer of
        Making.
        </p>
      <p>
        This year, we're chartering a train across America, and hosting the
        world's longest hackathon (in miles).
        </p>
      <p>
        We're starting at Hack Club HQ in Burlington Vermont, heading south
        to New York City, then crossing the rockies on our way to San
        Francisco, and end in Los Angeles.
        </p>
      <p>
        On the trip you'll code, make music, build, and write poetry. On the
        train you'll meet startup founders, an acrobat, 3 political exiles,
        and a philosopher.
        </p>
      <p>
        This trip is a gift from Hack Club to you and asks nothing in
        return. We want this to be a special, eclectic, and
        thought-provoking journey that you'll remember for the rest of your
        life.
        </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in joining us, please register your interest
        below. We are trying to fit as many Hack Clubbers as we can on The
        Hacker Zephyr.
