      <p>Every summer Hack Club does something special.</p>
      <p>
        In 2019 we brought 75 Hack Club leaders to San Francisco for Flagship.
        Last year, we gave a student $50k to distribute as hardware grants,
        launched <a href="https://scrapbook.hackclub.com">Scrapbook</a>, and
        hosted the <a href="https://scrapbook.hackclub.com">Summer of Making</a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        This year, we're chartering a train across America, and hosting the
        world's longest hackathon (in miles).
      </p>

        We're starting at{' '}

        , heading south to New York City, then crossing the rockies on our way
        to San Francisco, and end in Los Angeles.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the trip you'll code, make music, build, and write poetry. On the
        train you'll meet startup founders, an acrobat, 3 political exiles, and
        a philosopher.
      </p>
      <p>
        This trip is a gift from Hack Club to you and asks nothing in return. We
        want this to be a special, eclectic, and thought-provoking journey that
        you'll remember for the rest of your life.

        Zephyr.
